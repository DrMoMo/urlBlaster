urlBlaster.py is a script designed to do the following:
Accept a user defined source ip address
Accept a user defined source port

The script then, using a dictionary file, starts to generate www urls
according to a quantity you set. The script parses hotbot search results
in order to obtain the urls at somewhat random.

 It then performs a DNS lookup to get
the server's ip address which will serve as a destination ip address.

Once the data has been collected, using the scapy library, syn or 
HTTP GET requests (still working on the GETs) will be sent to those
destination ips for a duration of iteration you specify. 

The script also makes iptable rules in order to prevent the O/S from
sending RST packets

In the beginning of the script the most important varible to set is
your interface.

In order to prevent bottlenecking your traffic with SYNACKs coming back
I sugguest setting the source IP to a neighbor's.

enjoy,
JC
